# Ryanair-test

The main object of this project is to create a testing environment for the ryanair website and automate the following feature:
```
    Given I make a booking from "DUB" to "SXF" on 12/03/2019 for 2 adults and 1 child
    When I pay for booking with card details "5555 5555 5555 5557", "10/18" and "265"
    Then I should get payment declined message
```
### Features
* All scripts written with > Javascript & Cucumber: since the ryanair website is an Angular.JS application this was the logical choice because it has built-in methods that listen for Angularâ€™s JavaScript callbacks making everything easier.
* Page Object design pattern implementation.
* Extensive hooks implemented for BeforeFeature, AfterScenarios etc. //TODO: implement
* Screenshots on failure feature scenarios.

#### Pre-requisites

```

* Now just run the test command which launches the Chrome Browser and runs the scripts.
